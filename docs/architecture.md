# Codemixer Architecture

This document is the source of truth for *how Codemixer is put together*. [docs/style/code-style.md](style/code-style.md) governs how individual files read; [docs/style/visual-style.md](style/visual-style.md) governs how the product looks; this file governs how the system thinks. Read it once, fully, before you wire a new module to the engine, before you add an event, before you redraw an arrow.

When documents disagree, this file wins on structural decisions, `code-style.md` wins on how code reads, and `visual-style.md` wins on how something appears on screen.

## Platform applicability

Codemixer **ships on macOS 14+ only** (`Package.swift` declares `.macOS(.v14)`; there is no iOS target today). The architecture is structured so a **future** iOS / iPadOS / visionOS client could render the same `AgentEvent` stream over the remote-control API without forking the engine. Concrete decisions that lean on macOS (`posix_spawn`, FSEvents, `NWListener`, Keychain, `launchctl`, `NSWorkspace`) are tagged inline:

- **[macOS]** — shipped today.
- **[Roadmap: iOS / iPadOS / visionOS]** — not built yet; remote-control client only.
- **[Apple cross-platform]** — SwiftUI / Foundation patterns that would apply on other Apple platforms if we add them.
- **[Portable Swift]** — pure-Foundation wire DTOs in `AgentProtocol` (no platform imports).

The wire-protocol module `AgentProtocol` is [Portable Swift] by design — that boundary is what keeps a future mobile client from re-implementing the alphabet.

---

## 1. Why this document exists

Three reasons:

1. **The architecture is unusual.** Codemixer drives Claude Code through an *invisible* interactive terminal transport to avoid the Agent Credits path used by third-party / SDK-style Claude Code invocations, while also supporting direct protocol transports like Codex App Server stdio. The same engine runs in-process inside a Mac GUI app and standalone in a headless daemon. The same wire protocol carries Mac UI updates and remote iOS-client updates. None of these are off-the-shelf shapes; each warrants explicit justification.

2. **The constraints are unusually rigid.** Hidden PTY for Claude billing alignment, direct stdio for Codex, strict concurrency (Swift 6.2), headless capable (daemon), adapter-pluggable (multi-agent), remote-controllable (iOS later). Each constraint eliminates many otherwise-reasonable shapes; the survivors are described here so they don't get re-discovered by accident later.

3. **The wrong abstraction is expensive.** A misplaced `@MainActor`, an unscoped `Sendable` violation, a leaky adapter, a tightly-coupled UI binding, all rot the build. This document names the joints; future PRs are reviewed against it.

When a reviewer says *"this doesn't match the architecture"*, they mean this file.

---

## 2. Product surface in one paragraph

Codemixer is a native macOS workspace for driving CLI coding agents behind a typed transport seam: Claude Code under a hidden pseudo-terminal to stay on the interactive billing path and avoid Agent Credits, and Codex through App Server stdio JSON-RPC. The terminal is never shown; every byte or frame of agent output is translated into typed `AgentEvent`s and rendered by SwiftUI. The app runs as a GUI for direct use, as a headless daemon (`codemixerd`) for background sessions, and exposes a WebSocket remote-control API (TLS optional; see `RemoteDefaults`) that a future iOS client will speak verbatim. Architecture is event-sourced, actor-isolated, dependency-injected, and adapter-extensible by design.

---

## 3. Foundational constraints

Every shape downstream is the consequence of one of these. They are immovable.

### 3.1 Claude billing alignment (avoid Agent Credits)

We drive `claude` under an interactive TTY so usage stays on Claude's interactive subscription path. Third-party clients and SDK-style Claude Code invocations can route usage through Agent Credits; Codemixer must avoid that path. This eliminates:

- The Anthropic SDK / `--print` mode.
- The Agent SDK's `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` mode.
- Any path where `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is set to a non-interactive value.

This forces: hidden PTY, full TUI keep-alive, structured-event reconstruction from hooks + transcripts + minimal TUI scraping rather than first-class JSON streaming.

### 3.2 No visible terminal

Users see a SwiftUI app, never a terminal. SwiftTerm is used as a *headless* VT-510 engine (state, snapshots, DSR/DA reply generation) — never as a `TerminalView`. This forces:

- `TerminalEngine` is an `actor` wrapping `SwiftTerm.Terminal` with no view layer.
- The screen is data; the UI is rendered from `AgentEvent`s, not from terminal cells.
- TUI parsing is a fallback signal source, never the primary one.

### 3.3 Swift 6.2 strict concurrency

All targets compile with `StrictConcurrency = complete`. No `nonisolated(unsafe)` outside C-bridge files. No global mutable state. Cross-actor data is `Sendable`. This forces:

- `actor` over class for state-bearing types.
- `@MainActor` lives at the UI seam only — not inside the engine.
- Domain `AgentEvent` (Foundation types) and wire `AgentEventWire` (Codable DTOs) are separate; conversion at the network boundary.

### 3.4 Headless-first

The engine must run identically inside the GUI app and inside a no-SwiftUI daemon binary. This forces:

- `AgentEngine` is a plain `actor`, never `@MainActor`.
- `AgentCore` and `ClaudeCode` import zero SwiftUI / AppKit / UIKit.
- Every UI interaction routes through `AgentEngineCommandPort.send(_:)` — there is no UI-only fast path.
- `codemixerd` must not link `AgentUI` (enforced by SPM target dependencies and `scripts/check-no-swiftui-imports.swift`).

### 3.5 Adapter-pluggable

Adding `Cursor CLI` / `Gemini CLI` / `OpenCode` / `Copilot` must be a sibling target conforming to `AgentAdapter` — no edits to `AgentCore`, `AgentUI`, or `AgentProtocol`. This forces:

- All Claude-specific knowledge is quarantined in `AgenticCLIs/ClaudeCode` (`ClaudeCode` target).
- `AgentAdapter` is a complete protocol covering binary discovery, transport descriptor, env, auth, event sourcing, bootstrap bytes, user input/command encoding, permission responses, slash commands, and session listing.
- `AgentCapabilities` is an OptionSet that lets adapters declare which signal sources they use.

### 3.6 Remote-controllable

A future iOS client must speak the same protocol as the Mac UI. This forces:

- A pure-Foundation `AgentProtocol` target with `AgentCommand`, `AgentEventWire`, frame envelopes — no platform imports.
- The Mac UI uses the same `AgentEngineCommandPort` the remote client does; tests guarantee parity.
- `MulticastEventBus` fans out to N subscribers, with ring-buffer replay for reconnects.

### 3.7 Sandbox disabled, hardened runtime enabled

We spawn child processes, open PTYs, traverse the user's home directory, and watch arbitrary paths via FSEvents. App Sandbox is therefore off; Hardened Runtime stays on (we don't load third-party dylibs, so no `com.apple.security.cs.*` exemptions are needed). The Xcode app target keeps the sandbox entitlement absent (`src/CodemixerApp/Project.swift`).

---

## 4. The two-mode product

Codemixer has two deployment shapes, both built from the same `Codemixer` package:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mode A: GUI in-process (default for solo desktop use)               │
│                                                                      │
│   Codemixer.app  ─→  AgentEngine (actor, in-process)                │
│                       │                                              │
│                       └─→  ClaudeCode (`ClaudeAdapter`), PTY, transcript, hooks    │
│                                                                      │
│   AgentRemoteControl (optional, off by default) ─→ WebSocket on :8421  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mode B: Daemon + GUI (background sessions, multi-client)            │
│                                                                      │
│   codemixerd  ─→  AgentEngine (actor, headless)                      │
│                    │                                                 │
│                    └─→  AgentRemoteControl ─→ WebSocket on :8421       │
│                         HTTP sidecar on :8422 (health, attachments)    │
│                                                                      │
│   Codemixer.app  ─→  loopback WebSocket client of codemixerd         │
│                                                                      │
│   iPhone Codemixer Remote  ─→  LAN WebSocket client of codemixerd    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In Mode B, the Mac GUI is *just another remote client* talking over loopback (the same wire format the phone uses). This is the design's load-bearing decision: there is no "GUI fast path." Both modes use the same engine, the same wire protocol, the same command port, the same fan-out bus.

The user opts into Mode B via **Settings → Remote → Enable on login**, which writes a LaunchAgent plist. Until then, Mode A is the default and the daemon is dormant.

### 4.1 Two senses of "remote client"

The phrase **remote client** names a *role* in the architecture, not a single type. In code and docs it shows up in two related places. Confusing them is the most common onboarding mistake.

| Sense | Meaning | Primary symbols | When it applies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Client role** | Any process that drives the engine through the WebSocket wire (`ClientFrame` / `ServerFrame`) instead of holding `AgentEngine` in-process. | `RemoteEngineClient`, `Bootstrap.remoteClient` | Mode B Mac GUI (loopback), future iOS app, scripts, automation |
| **Connected-peer count** | How many WebSocket clients are currently attached to a running `RemoteControlServer`. | `RemoteControlServer.connectedClientCount`, `EngineViewModel.connectedRemoteClients`, `ConnectedClientsChip` | Mode A with **Settings → Remote → Enable remote access**, Mode B daemon, headless `codemixerd` |

**Client role (`RemoteEngineClient`).** Implements `AgentEngineCommandPort`. Commands become `ClientFrame.command`; inbound wire events are decoded and republished on a local `MulticastEventBus`. `EngineViewModel` binds to this exactly as it binds to an in-process `AgentEngine` — there is no GUI fast path. See [`src/Remote/AgentRemoteControl/README.md`](../src/Remote/AgentRemoteControl/README.md).

**Connected-peer count.** Observed on the *server* side. `Bootstrap+Remote.startRemote` registers `observeClientCount` and pushes the count into `EngineViewModel.setConnectedRemoteClients(_:)`, which drives the toolbar `ConnectedClientsChip` and **Settings → Remote → Connected clients**. The daemon uses the same count for idle exit (`codemixerd` exits after 10 minutes with 0 clients and a stopped engine).

#### Deployment matrix

| Deployment | Who owns `AgentEngine` | How the Mac GUI talks to the engine | What `connectedRemoteClients` counts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mode A (default)** | `Codemixer.app` in-process | Direct `AgentEngine.send` — not a WebSocket client | External peers only (0 until remote access is enabled and something connects) |
| **Mode A + remote access on** | `Codemixer.app` in-process | Still direct `AgentEngine.send` | iOS / scripts / other machines on the LAN — not the Mac GUI |
| **Mode B** | `codemixerd` | `RemoteEngineClient` over loopback WSS — the GUI **is** a remote client | Every attached WebSocket peer, **including the Mac GUI** |

In Mode B, one Mac process plays the client role while another process's server increments the connected-peer count — same protocol, opposite ends of the wire.

#### Symbol quick-reference

```
Mode B (daemon-backed):

  Codemixer.app                          codemixerd

## 5. SPM module map

The package `Codemixer` ships seven library targets, one C target, and eight test targets. `src/CodemixerApp/Codemixer.xcodeproj` adds a thin GUI app target (`Codemixer.app`); the daemon builds via SPM only.

### Target descriptions

| Target | Platform | Imports | Concern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CPosixBridge` | [macOS] (C99) | — | `openpty`, `posix_spawn` file-actions, `set_winsize`, `killpg`. Pure C; zero Swift between fork-equivalent boundary and `execve`. |
| `AgentProtocol` | [Portable Swift] | Foundation | `AgentCommand`, `AgentEventWire`, `ClientFrame` / `ServerFrame`, `AttachmentRef`, `PermissionDecision`, `StopReason`, prefs DTOs. No platform imports — compiles on macOS, iOS, Linux. |
| `AgentCore` | [Apple cross-platform] | `CPosixBridge`, `AgentProtocol`, `SwiftTerm` | The engine. PTY, spawner, reaper, env resolver, terminal engine, hook UDS server, FSEvents watcher, git diff, `AgentAdapter` protocol, `AgentEvent`, `AgentEngine`, `MulticastEventBus`, `HeartbeatActivityMonitor`, `StatusPhraseResolver`, `Seams/{Clock,RandomSource,Environment,FileSystem}`. No SwiftUI. |
| `ClaudeCode` | [Apple cross-platform] | `AgentCore`, `AgentProtocol` | Claude-specific integration: binary discovery, hooks, transcript JSONL, TUI fallback, shared path/input helpers, and the `ClaudeCodeTwin` digital twin. |
| `AgentRemoteControl` | [macOS] | `AgentCore`, `AgentProtocol`, Network, CryptoKit | `RemoteControlServer` (TLS NWListener), `PairingService`, `BonjourAdvertiser`, attachment HTTP staging, bearer-token store in Keychain. |
| `AgentUI` | [Apple cross-platform] | `AgentCore` | SwiftUI views and view-models. Imports `AgentCore` only. The `@MainActor` boundary lives here. |
| `AgentTestSupport` | [Portable Swift] | `AgentCore`, `AgentProtocol` | `MockAdapter`, deterministic `Clock` / `RandomSource` / `Environment` / `FileSystem` fakes, fixture loaders. Reusable in any test target. |

### Test targets

| Target | Path | Concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentProtocolTests` | `tests/Core/AgentProtocolTests/` | Wire frames, prefs/decisions `Codable`. |
| `AgentCoreTests` | `tests/Core/AgentCoreTests/` | Engine, PTY, bus, git, hooks, persistence, seams. |
| `ClaudeAdapterTests` | `tests/AgenticCLIs/ClaudeCode/ClaudeAdapterTests/` | Hook decode, transcript, TUI fallback, slash commands, fake-claude + opt-in live harness (`CODEMIXER_LIVE_CLAUDE=1`). |
| `ClaudeCodeTwinTests` | `tests/AgenticCLIs/ClaudeCode/ClaudeCodeTwinTests/` | Digital-twin contract and twin-driven engine E2E. |
| `CodexAdapterTests` | `tests/AgenticCLIs/Codex/CodexAdapterTests/` | App Server framing/RPC, scripted transports, opt-in live harness (`CODEMIXER_LIVE_CODEX=1`). |
| `CodexTwinTests` | `tests/AgenticCLIs/Codex/CodexTwinTests/` | `CodexTwin` projection only. |
| `AgentRemoteControlTests` | `tests/Remote/AgentRemoteControlTests/` | Pairing, TLS, sidecar, Bonjour, remote client, E2E. |
| `RemoteParityTests` | `tests/Remote/RemoteParityTests/` | Wire codec + command-dispatch parity canary. |
| `AgentUITests` | `tests/AgentUITests/` | View-model reduction, interaction coverage, voice/export. |
| `AgentTestSupportTests` | `tests/TestSupport/AgentTestSupportTests/` | Smoke tests for shared fakes (`FakeClock`, etc.). |

### Executable targets

| Target | Imports | Concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Codemixer.app` | `AgentUI`, `AgentRemoteControl`, `ClaudeCode`, `Codex` | The GUI. Registers `ClaudeAdapter()` and `CodexAdapter()` at startup. |
| `codemixerd` | `AgentCore`, `AgentRemoteControl`, `ClaudeCode`, `Codex` | The daemon. **Does not** link `AgentUI`. |
| `fake-claude` | `AgenticCLIs/ClaudeCode/digital-twin/fake-claude` | Minimal CLI twin for CI and local development without a real Claude login. |

### Hard import rules (lint-enforced)

- `AgentProtocol` may import only Foundation. No SwiftUI, no Network, no FSEvents, no AppKit.
- `AgentCore` may not import SwiftUI, AppKit, or UIKit.
- `ClaudeCode` may not import SwiftUI, AppKit, or UIKit.
- `AgentRemoteControl` may not import SwiftUI, AppKit, or UIKit.
- `AgentUI` may not import `ClaudeCode` or `AgentRemoteControl` — it imports `AgentCore` only.
- `codemixerd` may not link `AgentUI`.

These rules are checked locally by `scripts/check-no-swiftui-imports.swift` and `scripts/check-direct-framework-calls.swift` (see §27).

## 6. Layering and the dependency arrow

The dependency arrow points one way: from concrete to abstract, from outer to inner, from platform to portable.

```
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │   Codemixer.app      │     ← UI shell, registration
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                         ▼
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │      AgentUI         │     ← SwiftUI surface
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                         ▼
              ┌──────────────────────┐
   ┌──────────┤      AgentCore       ├──────────┐
   │          └──────────┬───────────┘          │
   ▼                     ▼                      ▼
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│ Adapter  │  │   AgentRemoteControl │  │ AgentTestSupport │
│ (Claude  │  │   (macOS-only)       │  │                  │
│  …)      │  │                      │  │                  │
└────┬─────┘  └──────────┬───────────┘  └──────────────────┘
     ▼                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│      AgentProtocol               │     ← portable wire types
└──────────────────────────────────┘
     ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  CPosixBridge / Foundation       │     ← the metal
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Rules of the arrow:

- **No module imports above it.** `AgentCore` cannot import `AgentUI`. `ClaudeCode` cannot import `AgentUI` or `AgentRemoteControl`. `AgentProtocol` cannot import anything platform-specific.
- **Cross-imports at the same layer are forbidden.** `ClaudeCode` and `AgentRemoteControl` never import each other. They both depend down on `AgentCore`; they communicate through `AgentEvent` / `AgentCommand`.
- **The boundary between domain and wire is explicit.** `AgentCore` speaks `AgentEvent` (Foundation types like `URL`, `Date`); `AgentProtocol` speaks `AgentEventWire` (Codable, string-encoded). `WireCodec` is the only place that converts.

A picture every contributor should be able to draw from memory.

---

## 7. Concurrency model

Codemixer is built on Swift 6.2 strict concurrency. The four isolation domains:

| Domain | Examples | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plain actor** | `AgentEngine`, `MulticastEventBus`, `PTYHost`, `TerminalEngine`, `HookServer`, `GitDiffEngine`, `HeartbeatActivityMonitor`, `StatusPhraseResolver`, `SessionStore` | All engine-side state. Run identically in GUI and daemon. Never `@MainActor`. |
- **`@MainActor`** | `EngineViewModel`, every SwiftUI `View`, speech recognizers | UI thread only. Subscribes to `bus.subscribe()` and folds `HistoryEntry` events on the main actor. |
| **Global concurrent (cooperative)** | `Task` for one-shot work (env resolution, login URL opening) | No long-lived loops; loops belong inside actors. |
| **`@unchecked Sendable` bridges** | `TerminalDelegate` shim around `SwiftTerm.Terminal`'s callback API; FSEvents callback shim; DispatchIO callback shim | Quarantined to specific files; documented invariants. Reviewed line-by-line. |

### Crossing isolation

- **Engine → UI**: the engine publishes onto `MulticastEventBus`; the UI subscribes via `AsyncStream<HistoryEntry>` and folds `entry.event` on `@MainActor`. There is no direct method call into UI code.
- **UI → Engine**: every user action constructs an `AgentCommand` and calls `await engine.send(_:)` through `AgentEngineCommandPort`. There is no direct method call into engine internals.
- **Engine → Adapter**: the engine awaits the adapter's `makeEventStream(inputs:)` — an `AsyncStream<AgentEvent>`. The adapter is `Sendable`; its closure may run on any executor.
- **Adapter → Engine**: adapters do not call back into the engine. They emit events; the engine ingests them.

### Sendable boundaries

- All public types in `AgentProtocol` are `Sendable`.
- All public types in `AgentCore` that cross actor boundaries (`AgentEvent`, `AgentCommand`, `AgentCapabilities`, `LaunchContext`, `PermissionPrompt`, `ToolInput`, `ToolOutput`) are `Sendable`.
- `URL`, `UUID`, `Date`, `Duration` are inherently `Sendable`.
- Where SwiftTerm types must cross, we wrap them in actor-isolated `Snapshot` value types — never expose `SwiftTerm.Terminal` directly.

### The `@MainActor` rule

The only `@MainActor`-tagged types in the entire SPM kit are inside `AgentUI`. Outside `AgentUI`, `@MainActor` is forbidden. This is checked at PR time by grepping for `@MainActor` outside `src/AgentUI/`.

## 8. The event-sourced core

Codemixer's core data flow is **event sourced**. Every observable thing is an `AgentEvent`; every UI surface (and every remote client) derives its state by folding the event stream. There is no second source of truth.

### The `AgentEvent` grammar

```swift
public enum AgentEvent: Sendable {
    case sessionStarted(sessionID: String, model: String?, cwd: URL)
    case userTurn(id: String, text: String)
    case textDelta(messageID: UUID, delta: String)
    case assistantText(id: String, blockID: String, text: String, isFinal: Bool)
    case thinkingChunk(blockID: UUID, delta: String)
    case thinkingComplete(blockID: UUID, duration: Duration)
    case toolStart(id: String, name: String, input: ToolInput, startedAt: Date)
    case toolProgress(callID: UUID, progress: ToolProgress)
    case toolEnd(id: String, success: Bool, output: ToolOutput, durationMS: Int)
    case permissionRequest(prompt: PermissionPrompt)
    case permissionAlreadyResolved(id: UUID, byDevice: String)
    case statusPhraseChanged(source: StatusPhraseSource, phrase: String)
    case activityStateChanged(ActivitySubstate)
    case noEventGap(turnID: UUID, elapsed: Duration)
    case authURL(URL)
    case bell
    case fileTouched(URL, kind: FileChangeKind)
    case usage(tokens: Int, costUSD: Double?)
    case engineRestarted
    case stopped(reason: StopReason)
    case error(AgentError)
}
```

### Five categorical roles

| Role | Cases |
| --- | --- |
| **Session lifecycle** | `sessionStarted`, `engineRestarted`, `stopped`, `error` |
| **Conversation** | `userTurn`, `textDelta`, `assistantText`, `thinkingChunk`, `thinkingComplete` |
| **Tool execution** | `toolStart`, `toolProgress`, `toolEnd` |
| **Permissions** | `permissionRequest`, `permissionAlreadyResolved` |
| **Activity & ambient** | `statusPhraseChanged`, `activityStateChanged`, `noEventGap`, `authURL` (legacy wire; adapters use `authenticationRequired` errors for setup), `bell`, `fileTouched`, `usage` |

A consumer that knows nothing else can render a complete conversation by folding these events. New event cases require: (a) wire DTO in `AgentEventWire`, (b) `WireCodec` round-trip, (c) `RemoteParityTests` coverage, (d) a UI consumer or an explicit decision that none is wanted.

### Event identity and replay

- Every event carries a UUID at the wire boundary (`AgentEventWire.id`). Generated by the engine on publish.
- The bus's ring buffer (500 events) is keyed by these UUIDs.
- Remote clients send `lastSeenEventID` on subscribe; the bus replays everything after it.
- Replays are *idempotent at the consumer*: each consumer must tolerate seeing the same event twice (it does, because the consumer's state is derived from a fold).

### Domain vs wire

- `AgentEvent` lives in `AgentCore`. It uses Foundation types directly (`URL`, `Date`, `Duration`).
- `AgentEventWire` lives in `AgentProtocol`. It's a `Codable` mirror with string-encoded URLs, ISO-8601 dates, and millisecond `Duration`.
- `WireCodec.encode(_:) -> AgentEventWire` / `WireCodec.decode(_:) -> AgentEvent` is the only conversion site.
- `RemoteParityTests` verifies every case round-trips losslessly via a property test.

## 9. The transport pipeline

Underneath every adapter is the same engine-facing transport seam. Terminal
emulation is not the engine model; it is the `.interactiveTerminal` strategy
used by Claude Code. Codex uses `.stdioJSONRPC` and talks directly to
`codex app-server --stdio`.

```
AgentAdapter.transportDescriptor
        │
        ▼
AgentTransportFactory
        ├── .interactiveTerminal ─► InteractiveTerminalTransport
        │                           ├─ PTYHost (private implementation)
        │                           └─ TerminalEngine snapshots + bell stream
        ├── .stdioJSONRPC ────────► StdioJSONRPCTransport
        │                           └─ Process pipes: stdin/stdout/stderr
        └── .agentClientProtocol ─► StdioJSONRPCTransport
                                    └─ same NDJSON stdio host; ACP framing in adapter
        │
        ▼
AgentInputs(outputBytes, terminal?, hookSocket?, workspace, sessionID)
        │
        ▼
adapter.makeEventStream(inputs:) ─► AgentEvent stream
```

### AgentTransport shape

```swift
public enum AgentTransportKind: Sendable, Hashable, Codable {
    case interactiveTerminal
    case stdioJSONRPC
    case agentClientProtocol
}

protocol AgentTransport: Sendable {
    var outboundBytes: AsyncStream<Data> { get }
    var bellEvents: AsyncStream<Void> { get }
    var terminalSnapshot: (any TerminalSnapshotting)? { get }
    func write(_ data: Data) async throws
    func interrupt() async
    func close() async
}
```

`AgentTransportLaunchSpec` is transport-neutral: executable, arguments,
environment, working directory, and window size. `PTYHost.ChildSpec` stays
private to `InteractiveTerminalTransport`; stdio/client-protocol transports
never depend on PTY-named launch types.

### Process spawn invariants

- **Interactive terminal transport:** zero Swift code between `posix_spawn` and
  `execve`. The C shim owns `openpty`/`posix_spawn`; the slave PTY becomes the
  controlling TTY, which keeps Claude on the interactive billing path and avoids
  Agent Credits from third-party / SDK-style invocations.
- **Stdio JSON-RPC transport:** long-lived `Foundation.Process` wrapper in
  `External/StdioJSONRPCTransport.swift`; stdout is agent output, stderr is a
  bounded diagnostics tail, and cancel is a JSON-RPC frame rather than SIGINT.
- **ACP:** uses the same `StdioJSONRPCTransport` host; the
  `AgentClientProtocol` adapter owns JSON-RPC 2.0 framing and session mapping.

### PTYHost shape

```swift
public actor PTYHost {
    public let outboundBytes: AsyncStream<Data>   // bytes from child stdout/stderr
    public func write(_ bytes: Data) async throws
    public func resize(to size: WindowSize) throws
    public func interrupt()                       // killpg(SIGINT)
    public func close() async
}
```

- Default window 48×160, **fixed across UI resizes** so the TUI fallback parser sees a stable layout.
- Reads use `DispatchIO` stream channel; writes go through a serial dispatch queue inside the actor.
- `FD_CLOEXEC` is set on the master immediately after `openpty`.
- `PTYHost` is not the engine seam anymore; `InteractiveTerminalTransport`
  wraps it behind `AgentTransport`. Tests inject scripted transports to
  deterministically force write failures, verify exact bytes, and prove event
  ordering without racing a real child process.

### TerminalEngine shape

```swift
public actor TerminalEngine: TerminalSnapshotting {
    let outboundReplies: AsyncStream<Data>   // DSR/CPR/XTVERSION/mouse/focus replies
    func feed(_ bytes: Data)
    func resize(to size: WindowSize)
    func snapshotRows() -> [String]
    func snapshotText() -> String
    func cursorRow() -> Int
    func consumeBell() -> Bool
}
```

- `@preconcurrency import SwiftTerm`.
- A `TerminalDelegate` shim is `@unchecked Sendable` and forwards `send(source:data:)` to `outboundReplies`. `AgentEngine` deliberately does **not** write those replies back to the child; the agent is our peer, not a real terminal host.
- The engine is *engine-only*; there is no view. Snapshots are value types.

### Cleanup

- **`ChildReaper`** installs `SIG_IGN` on `SIGCHLD` early, then a `DispatchSource.makeSignalSource(.signal, SIGCHLD)` that `waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)` in a loop. Emits `.exited(pid, status)` events.
- **Graceful shutdown** is `killpg(SIGTERM) → 2s grace → killpg(SIGKILL) → waitpid → close PTY`. The reaper guarantees zombies don't accumulate.

---

## 10. Event source priority

The engine fuses up to four signal sources into one canonical event stream. The priorities are deterministic:

1. **Hooks (UDS, injected via `--settings`)** — ground truth for tool lifecycle: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`. Claude's contract is documented at `code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks`; the JSON payload is the most stable signal we have. Adapters that don't support hooks declare a different capability set.

2. **Transcript JSONL tailer** — canonical assistant message text, thinking blocks, and tool args / results, written by the agent itself. For Claude this is `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`. Tailed with `lseek`+poll, not FSEvents (more responsive on writes-to-end-of-file).

3. **FSEvents on workspace** — covers any file change outside hook coverage (manual edits during a run, sibling tools, untracked tools). Drives the diff panel; never the conversation surface.

4. **TUI secondary parser** (SwiftTerm headless snapshots) — narrow scope only:
   - Live status phrase ("Pondering…", spinners) for `StatusPhraseResolver`.
   - Edge-case permission prompts the adapter didn't catch via hooks.
   - Diagnostic fallback when other sources miss an event.
   **Never** used for assistant chat text or tool arguments. This collapses the highest risk in v1.

### Why priority matters

If hooks say *"PostToolUse(Edit) at t=42"* and the transcript also yields *"tool_use result at t=42"*, the engine de-dupes by `(toolCallID, kind)` — emitting one `toolEnd` event. The hook always wins on lifecycle timing; the transcript fills in payload details the hook elided.

### Where the fusion happens

Inside the adapter's `makeEventStream(inputs:)`. The engine does **not** fuse; it merely consumes the merged stream. This keeps Claude-specific reconciliation logic out of `AgentCore`.

---

## 11. `AgentAdapter` — the agent extension point

Every CLI agent is integrated through a single protocol. The complete contract:

```swift
public protocol AgentAdapter: Sendable {
    // 1. Identity
    var id: AgentID { get }
    var displayName: String { get }
    var iconSymbol: String { get }

    // 2. Discovery, launch & transport
    func locateBinary(env: ResolvedEnvironment) async throws -> URL
    func defaultEnvOverrides() -> [String: String]
    func buildLaunchArgv(context: LaunchContext) -> [String]
    var transportDescriptor: AgentTransportDescriptor { get }

    // 3. Authentication
    func authStatus(env: ResolvedEnvironment) async -> AuthStatus

    // 4. Event sources
    var capabilities: AgentCapabilities { get }

    // 5. Event ingestion
    func makeEventStream(inputs: AgentInputs) -> AsyncStream<AgentEvent>

    // 6. Sending input
    func encodeUserPrompt(_ text: String) -> Data
    func cancelSequence() -> Data
    func sessionBootstrapBytes(context: LaunchContext) -> Data
    func encodeCommand(_ command: AgentCommand) -> Data?

    // 7. Permission responses
    func encodePermissionResponse(_ decision: PermissionDecision,
                                  for prompt: PermissionPrompt) -> PermissionResponseDelivery

    // 8. Slash commands
    var slashCommandCatalog: [SlashCommand] { get }
    func enumerateProjectCommands(workspace: URL) async -> [SlashCommand]

    // 9. Model catalog (composer picker)
    func availableModels() -> [AgentModelOption]
    func modelCatalogRefreshKind() -> ModelCatalogRefreshKind
    func refreshModelCatalog() async throws -> [AgentModelOption]
    func seedModelCatalog(_ models: [AgentModelOption])

    // 10. Agent modes (composer bottom-bar mode dropdown)
    func availableAgentModes() -> [AgentModeOption]

    // 11. Resume / session listing
    func listResumableSessions(workspace: URL) async -> [SessionSummary]
    func resumeArgvAddition(sessionID: String) -> [String]
}
```

The adapter owns command encoding. Claude's default implementation emits slash
text; Codex overrides with JSON-RPC frames. Unsupported commands are surfaced as
explicit `.error(.unsupportedCommand)` events, never silently skipped.

### Model catalogs

Composer model pickers are filled **before** the workspace UI becomes usable.
`WorkspaceLifecycle` (`AgentUI/Workspace/WorkspaceLifecycle.swift`) is the
shared create/open path:

| Call | When |
| --- | --- |
| `openEmptyWorkspace(_:)` | New Workspace / reopen empty shell |
| `loadModelCatalogs(at:rootProjectType:)` | Open / restore a workspace with projects |
| `ensureModels(for:)` | Create / add / restore a project that introduces an adapter |

Only shipping adapters **used by projects in that workspace** are warmed
(pinned types → that agent; `.mixed` → every `SupportedBuiltInAgent.shipping`
id). Custom projects contribute no shipping catalog.

`ModelCatalogRefreshKind` splits persistence:

| Kind | Adapters | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.manual(detail:)` | Claude Code | Workspace file cache in `<workspace>/.codemixer/workspace.json` (`adapterModelCaches`). Load from cache whenever non-empty; live probe once on first empty cache, or when the user taps **Refresh models** in Settings → Workspace. |
| `.automatic` | Codex, Cursor, … | In-memory only (Codex may also read `~/.codex/models_cache.json`). Never written to `workspace.json`. |

Bootstrap sets `isPreparingWorkspace` while create/open awaits catalog warm;
`RootView` keeps the loading spinner up until that flag clears. Project create /
add is `async` and blocks the New Project sheet until `ensureModels` succeeds.

### Agent modes are provider-owned, not UI-hardcoded

The composer's bottom-bar mode dropdown (the menu next to the model picker)
never hardcodes a vendor's mode list. Each adapter publishes its own
`[AgentModeOption]` from `availableAgentModes()`:

- Claude Code: Agent / Think / Review, each activating via
  `setPermissionMode` / `toggleThinkMode` / `toggleReviewMode`.
- Codex: Agent / Review, via `toggleReviewMode`.
- Cursor (ACP): Agent / Plan / Ask, via `session/set_mode` (see
  `CursorModeCommand.sessionModes`).

`AgentModeOption` (`Core/AgentProtocol/AgentModeOption.swift`) pairs a stable
`id`/`label` with the ordered `[AgentCommand]` to send on selection.
`EngineViewModel.availableAgentModes` / `selectedAgentModeID` hold the active
adapter's list; `ComposerModeModelMenus` renders it generically and reduces
`current_mode_update`-derived `statusPhraseChanged("Mode: <id>")` events back
into `selectedAgentModeID` so externally-driven mode switches (e.g. a slash
prompt) stay in sync. Adding a new agent CLI with its own mode taxonomy never
requires a UI change — only a new `availableAgentModes()` implementation.

This is distinct from `ProjectType`
(`Core/AgentCore/Persistence/ProjectType.swift`), which chooses *which agent
CLI* a project uses (Claude-only, Codex-only, Cursor-only, mixed, custom) —
see [`WorkspaceProjectsStore`](#workspaceprojectsstore) below.

### `AgentCapabilities`

```swift
public struct AgentCapabilities: OptionSet, Sendable {
    public static let hooksOverUDS         = AgentCapabilities(rawValue: 1 << 0)
    public static let transcriptJSONL      = AgentCapabilities(rawValue: 1 << 1)
    public static let ptyTUIFallback       = AgentCapabilities(rawValue: 1 << 3)
    public static let permissionPrompts    = AgentCapabilities(rawValue: 1 << 5)
    public static let resumableSessions    = AgentCapabilities(rawValue: 1 << 6)
}
```

Transport is deliberately not a capability. The engine reads
`transportDescriptor` to choose the process/connection shape, then reads
`capabilities` and wires up only what's needed:

- `.hooksOverUDS` → start `HookServer`, plumb the socket into `AgentInputs`.
- `.transcriptJSONL` → adapter is responsible for tailing; engine just provides `sessionID` hot stream.
- `.ptyTUIFallback` → adapter consumes `inputs.terminal` snapshots.
- `.permissionPrompts` → `PermissionResponseDelivery` is honored.
- `.resumableSessions` → enables the *Sessions* picker.

### `PermissionResponseDelivery`

A response can travel two channels — back into the PTY (the agent's TUI permission prompt) or as JSON stdout to the hook process (Claude's hook-driven `Notification` flow). The adapter chooses; the engine writes.

```swift
public enum PermissionResponseDelivery: Sendable {
    case writePTY(Data)
    case respondToHookProcess(jsonStdout: Data)
    case both(ptyBytes: Data, hookStdout: Data)
}
```

### `AdapterRegistry`

```swift
public actor AdapterRegistry {
    public static let shared = AdapterRegistry()
    public func register(_ adapter: any AgentAdapter)
    public func all() -> [any AgentAdapter]
    public func adapter(for id: AgentID) -> (any AgentAdapter)?
}
```

The GUI and daemon register `ClaudeAdapter()` and `CodexAdapter()` at startup.
New adapters scaffold under `src/AgenticCLIs/<AgentName>/` (see
`src/AgenticCLIs/README.md`), ship as their own SPM library target, and register
with one `register` call; UI affordances should keep resolving adapters through
`AdapterRegistry` rather than importing adapter targets.

---

## 12. `AgentCommand` — the input alphabet

The engine has exactly one input port: `AgentEngineCommandPort.send(_ command: AgentCommand) async throws`. There is no UI-only fast path; every action — local or remote — constructs a typed command.

```swift
public enum AgentCommand: Codable, Sendable {
    case sendPrompt(text: String, attachments: [AttachmentRef])
    case cancelCurrentTurn
    case editAndResubmitLast(target: UUID, text: String, attachments: [AttachmentRef])
    case respondToPermission(id: UUID, decision: PermissionDecision)
    case newSession
    case compact
    case selectModel(id: String)
    case setPermissionMode(PermissionMode)
    case toggleThinkMode(Bool)
    case toggleReviewMode(Bool)
    case runSlashCommand(name: String, args: [String])
    case runCustomCommand(path: String, args: [String])
    case openProject(URL)
    case closeSession
    case speakAssistantBubble(id: String)
    case revertFile(URL)
    case revertHunk(URL, hunkID: UUID)
    case updateAutoApprovalRules([AutoApprovalRule])
    case updateAppearancePref(key: AppearancePrefKey, value: AppearancePrefValue)
    case requestSnapshot(SnapshotKind)
}
```

### Three command-shape categories

| Category | Examples | Engine response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent input** | `sendPrompt`, `cancelCurrentTurn`, `editAndResubmitLast`, `runSlashCommand` | Translated to transport bytes via `adapter.encodeUserPrompt(_:)` / `adapter.encodeCommand(_:)`. |
| **Engine state** | `newSession`, `selectModel`, `setPermissionMode`, `toggleThinkMode` | Encoded by the adapter; Claude uses slash-command lines, Codex uses JSON-RPC frames. |
| **Out-of-band** | `revertFile`, `updateAutoApprovalRules`, `updateAppearancePref`, `requestSnapshot`, `speakAssistantBubble` | Handled by a higher-level service layer (`GitDiffEngine`, `SessionStore`, TTS). The engine returns immediately. |

The third category may sound like a violation of the single-port discipline — it isn't. The *port* is still single; the engine is a tiny router that fans out to subsystems for non-agent commands. The wire protocol remains uniform; the mobile client sends `updateAppearancePref` the same way it sends `sendPrompt`.

### Why command-based UI?

- **Parity.** Mac UI ↔ remote client wire compatibility is a property test (`RemoteParityTests`).
- **Auditability.** Every state change is observable as a command in the daemon log.
- **Headless symmetry.** The daemon has no UI; commands are the only way in.

---

## 13. `AgentEngine` — the orchestrator

`AgentEngine` is the actor that owns the running session.

### Lifecycle

```text
init(seams: Seams = .live)
  ↓
start(adapter:, workspace:, resumeSessionID:, permissionMode:)
  ↓
  • ShellEnvironmentResolver.resolve()
  • adapter.locateBinary(env:)
  • if .hooksOverUDS ∈ capabilities: HookServer.start()
  • argv = adapter.buildLaunchArgv(context: LaunchContext)
  • transportFactory(AgentTransportLaunchSpec(...), descriptor:)
    - production factory constructs InteractiveTerminalTransport or StdioJSONRPCTransport
    - tests may inject scripted AgentTransport implementations
  • adapter.sessionBootstrapBytes(context:) written after transport is live
  • adapter.makeEventStream(inputs:) → consume on a Task → ingest(_)
  • HeartbeatActivityMonitor — drives noEventGap + activityStateChanged
  • state = .running(sessionID: nil)
  ↓
send(_ command: AgentCommand) async throws
  ↓
shutdown(reason:)
  ↓
  • cancel forwarding task
  • close transport
  • stop HookServer
  • stop FSEventsWatcher
  • drain MulticastEventBus
  • publish .stopped(reason:)
  • state = .stopped
```

### Internal state

```swift
public actor AgentEngine: AgentEngineCommandPort {
    public let bus: MulticastEventBus
    private var adapter: (any AgentAdapter)?
    private var state: EngineState
    private var transport: (any AgentTransport)?
    private var terminal: (any TerminalSnapshotting)?
    private var hookServer: HookServer?
    private var fsWatcher: FSEventsWatcher?
    private var currentSessionID: String?
    private var currentTurnID: UUID?
    private var pendingPermissions: [UUID: PermissionPrompt]
    private var lastUserBubbleID: UUID?
    private var heartbeat: HeartbeatActivityMonitor?
    private var phraseResolver: StatusPhraseResolver
}
```

### What the engine *does not* do

- Render anything.
- Speak Claude's hook JSON schema.
- Decide auto-approval policy (that's a higher service).
- Maintain conversation history (clients fold the bus stream themselves).

The engine is small on purpose. Most logic lives in adapters and clients.

---

## 14. `MulticastEventBus` — fan-out and replay

The bus is the engine's outbound port. Each published event is wrapped in a bus-assigned `HistoryEntry` (opaque `UUID` + `AgentEvent`). Subscribers receive `AsyncStream<HistoryEntry>`, not bare events.

```swift
public actor MulticastEventBus {
    public struct HistoryEntry: Sendable {
        public let id: UUID          // opaque checkpoint token
        public let event: AgentEvent
    }

    public struct Subscription: Sendable {
        public let id: UUID
        public let stream: AsyncStream<HistoryEntry>
    }

    public enum SubscribeOutcome: Sendable, Equatable {
        case fresh, resumed, checkpointExpired
    }

    public func subscribe() -> Subscription
    public func subscribe(after: UUID?) -> Subscription
    public func subscribeWithOutcome(after: UUID?) -> (Subscription, SubscribeOutcome)
    @discardableResult public func publish(_ event: AgentEvent) -> UUID
    public func unsubscribe(_ id: UUID)
}
```

### Properties

- **N subscribers.** In Mode B, the GUI is one subscriber, each remote client is another. No special-casing.
- **Per-subscriber bounded queue.** Default `StreamBufferDefaults.eventHistory` (500). Drop-oldest on overflow; there is no separate overflow signal — consumers that need a full rebuild request a snapshot.
- **Ring buffer of last 500 `HistoryEntry` values** for reconnect replay. `subscribe(after:)` replays only entries after the checkpoint; unknown or expired checkpoints replay the full buffer and report `.checkpointExpired` via `subscribeWithOutcome`.
- **Self-cleaning subscriptions.** Each stream registers `onTermination` to call `unsubscribe`, so cancelled UI tasks and debug tails do not leak continuations.
- **No reordering.** Events are delivered in publish order to each subscriber.

### Backpressure model

Subscribers consume on their own schedule. If a remote client falls behind, its queue overflows independently — other subscribers are unaffected. On reconnect, the client sends `ClientFrame.subscribe(lastSeenEventID:)`; the server replays the delta and responds with `ServerFrame.subscribed(latestEventID:outcome:)`. When `outcome == .checkpointExpired`, `RemoteEngineClient` publishes `.engineRestarted` and pulls fresh snapshots so the client can rebuild.

### Tests

`MulticastEventBusTests` covers replay ordering, checkpoint resume/expiry, and self-unsubscribe on stream cancellation.

---

## 15. Activity indicators subsystem

The "agent feels alive between events" experience is implemented entirely server-side, in two cooperating actors.

### `HeartbeatActivityMonitor`

```swift
actor HeartbeatActivityMonitor {
    func startTurn(_ id: UUID, baseline: ActivitySubstate) async
    func bump(baseline: ActivitySubstate) async      // called on every event
    func endTurn() async
    // Emits noEventGap(turnID:, elapsed:) every 500ms while non-idle.
    // Emits activityStateChanged(_:) on substate transitions.
}
```

State machine:

```text
.idle ─(turn begins)─▶ .awaitingFirstChunk
                          │
                          │  ≥ 800ms  →  .working
                          │  ≥ 10s    →  .stalled
                          │  ≥ 90s    →  .suspectedHang
                          ▼
                    .streamingText / .thinking / .runningTool  (whichever event arrives)
                          │
                          └─(turn ends)─▶  .idle
```

Locked thresholds (800ms / 10s / 90s) live in `AgentCore` only — never replicated in clients. Clients merely consume `activityStateChanged(_:)` and react.

### `StatusPhraseResolver`

```swift
actor StatusPhraseResolver {
    func ingest(_ snapshot: TerminalEngine.Snapshot) async   // TUI hint
    func setActiveTool(_ name: String?) async
    func setThinkingPhrase(_ phrase: String?) async
    // Emits statusPhraseChanged(source:, phrase:) on change.
}
```

Priority (high → low):

1. Active tool name (`"Running Bash…"`).
2. Live thinking-block phrase from the transcript (`"Searching for prior art…"`).
3. TUI-parsed phrase from the SwiftTerm snapshot (`"Pondering…"`).
4. Default `"Working… (Ns)"` with elapsed seconds from the heartbeat.

Clients render the resolved phrase verbatim. They do not re-derive priority.

### Why server-side

If `noEventGap` / `activityStateChanged` were client-side, the GUI and the mobile remote would disagree about *when* the agent went stalled (different clocks, different jitter). Server-side resolution means every client sees the same activity state, the same Nth second, the same crossfade — guaranteed by the bus order. This is essential for multi-client coherence.

---

## 16. Dependency injection seams

Every non-deterministic dependency the engine touches has a protocol seam in `Core/AgentCore/Seams/` and a deterministic fake in `AgentTestSupport`. The four cross-engine seams:

```swift
public protocol AgentClock: Sendable {
    func now() -> Date
    func monotonic() -> ContinuousClock.Instant
    func sleep(for duration: Duration) async throws
}

public protocol RandomSource: Sendable {
    func next<T: FixedWidthInteger>(in range: Range<T>) -> T
    func uuid() -> UUID
}

public protocol Environment: Sendable {
    func value(for key: String) -> String?
    func snapshot() -> [String: String]
}

public protocol FileSystem: Sendable {
    func fileExists(at: URL) -> Bool
    func isDirectory(at: URL) -> Bool
    func createDirectory(at: URL, intermediates: Bool) throws
    func readData(from: URL) throws -> Data
    func writeAtomically(_ data: Data, to: URL) throws
    func remove(at: URL) throws
    func contentsOfDirectory(at: URL) throws -> [URL]
    func modificationDate(of: URL) throws -> Date
}
```

### Live vs fake

- `Core/AgentCore/Seams/SystemClock.swift`, `SystemRandom.swift`, `ProcessEnvironment.swift`, `SystemFileSystem.swift` — live implementations.
- `AgentTestSupport/FakeClock.swift`, `FakeRandom.swift`, `InMemoryEnvironment.swift`, `InMemoryFileSystem.swift` — deterministic doubles with seek / advance / preload APIs.

### Wired through `Seams`

A single value struct carries all four into the engine:

```swift
public struct Seams: Sendable {
    public var clock: any AgentClock
    public var random: any RandomSource
    public var environment: any Environment
    public var fileSystem: any FileSystem
    public static let live = Seams(clock: SystemClock(), random: SystemRandom(),
                                   environment: ProcessEnvironment(), fileSystem: SystemFileSystem())
}
```

Every actor that needs any of these takes a `Seams` (or the specific seam protocol) at init. **Direct calls to `Date()`, `Int.random`, `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment`, or `FileManager.default` outside `Seams/Live*.swift` are forbidden by a custom SwiftLint rule.**

### Why this matters

Without seams, every async test of the heartbeat ticker would have to actually sleep 500ms. With seams, `FakeClock.advance(by: .seconds(10))` deterministically drives 20 heartbeats in a millisecond. The same applies to UUID generation in tests (predictable IDs), env resolution (no shell), and file IO (no disk).

`AgentTransport` is the narrower engine-local seam. It exists to test write,
interrupt, and close failures deterministically; it is injected through
`AgentEngine`'s internal test initializer. Adapters declare a descriptor, not a
concrete transport implementation.

## 17. Engine lifecycle and turn reduction

### Engine lifecycle (`EngineState`)

The engine tracks coarse lifecycle only — not conversation content:

```swift
public enum EngineState: Sendable, Equatable {
    case stopped
    case starting
    case running(sessionID: String?)
    case stopping
}
```

`AgentEngine.currentState` is used by the daemon idle-exit loop and health reporting. Conversation messages, tool cards, permissions, and activity substate live in **`EngineViewModel`** (and remote clients' own reducers), which fold the `MulticastEventBus` stream on `@MainActor`.

### A canonical turn (event fold)

```
(user sends prompt via AgentCommand.sendPrompt)
  ↓  AgentEvent.userTurn   (engine echo; all surfaces render bubble)
  ↓  AgentEvent.thinkingChunk*  (streams into a ThinkingBlock)
  ↓  AgentEvent.thinkingComplete(duration:)
  ↓  AgentEvent.toolStart / toolProgress* / toolEnd  (may iterate)
  ↓  AgentEvent.permissionRequest  (optional)
  ↓  AgentCommand.respondToPermission → agent resumes
  ↓  AgentEvent.assistantText(isFinal: true)
  ↓  activity returns to idle via HeartbeatActivityMonitor.endTurn
```

There is no separate `AgentState` reducer in `AgentCore`. The engine publishes events; clients reduce them.

### Optimistic send + echo reconciliation

To keep sending instant, `EngineViewModel.sendPrompt` appends the user bubble and flips to a working state on the main actor *before* the engine round-trip, then reconciles when the real `.userTurn` arrives. Two subtleties make this safe:

- The engine publishes `.userTurn` + starts the heartbeat **before** the awaited transport write, so every surface — GUI and remote clients — reflects the turn at the same instant rather than after the write + bus fan-out. A failed write still throws, so the caller surfaces the error. `AgentEngineCommandTests` pins the publish-before-write invariant with an injected failing transport; `RemoteControlE2ETests` pins the wire-visible ordering (`.userTurn` event before the failing command result).
- Claude double-emits the **user** turn (engine echo + the `UserPromptSubmit` hook). The view model arms a short dedup window (`ActivityTiming.userTurnEchoWindow`): the first matching echo adopts the engine's id onto the optimistic bubble; the second is dropped. If the send throws, the optimistic bubble rolls back and the status resets. Genuinely different turns always append.
- Claude can also double-emit the **assistant** reply (transcript JSONL + Stop `last_assistant_message`). That fusion lives in `ClaudeAdapter`: drain the transcript on Stop, then drop hook `assistantText` when the tailer has already emitted for the session. Transcript is canonical; Stop is fallback. See `ClaudeCode/CONTRACT.md` and `ClaudeAdapterEventStreamTests`.

### Transport write-failure contract

Every command that writes to the transport uses the same `AgentEngineCommandPort`
path whether it originated from SwiftUI, the daemon API, or a remote client.
The tested contract is:

- If command encoding succeeds, the engine attempts exactly the adapter-produced
  bytes at the `AgentTransport.write` boundary.
- If the write throws, `engine.send(_:)` throws the same error. Remote clients
  receive a failed `ServerFrame.result`; the UI command port rolls back any
  optimistic local state.
- `.sendPrompt` is the only write command that publishes a user-visible event
  before the write. That ordering is intentional and pinned: all subscribers
  see `.userTurn` before a write failure is reported.
- `.cancelCurrentTurn` writes the adapter cancel sequence first and calls
  `interrupt()` only after the write succeeds. A failed cancel write must not
  send SIGINT.
- `editAndResubmitLast` has two separate transport failure points: the pre-restart
  cancel write and the post-restart revised prompt write. Tests use a scripted
  transport factory so the restarted session receives a fresh transport.
- `respondToPermission` covers all adapter delivery modes:
  `.writePTY`, `.both`, and `.respondToHookProcess`. Hook-only delivery must
  not touch the transport; transport-backed delivery propagates write failures.

### Cancel paths

- `cancelCurrentTurn` → adapter's `cancelSequence()` written to PTY → adapter emits `toolEnd(success: false, output: .cancelled)` or `assistantText(isFinal: true, text: <partial>)` → state returns to `.idle`.
- App quit / engine `shutdown` → `engine.shutdown(reason: .userCancel)` → published `.stopped(reason:)` → state `.shutdown`.

## 18. Permissions subsystem

Permissions are the most multi-party flow in the system. Their architecture:

```
agent (TUI)
   │
   │ "Allow Bash to run `git push`?"
   ▼
hook (Notification or PreToolUse)  ───► HookServer  ───► adapter
                                                          │
                                                          │ AgentEvent.permissionRequest

                                                                          adapter.encodePermissionResponse(_:for:)
                                                                                          │

                                                                                          │
                                                              ┌───────────────────────────┘
                                                              ▼
                                           success → agent resumes
                                           failure → command throws / remote result fails
```

### Properties

- **First responder wins.** Multiple clients may show the same prompt; the engine accepts the first valid `respondToPermission(id:, decision:)` and drops further responses for the same prompt id because the prompt has already been removed from `pendingPermissions`.
- **Timeout cleanup.** If no client responds before `permissionTimeout`, the engine auto-denies, publishes `permissionAlreadyResolved(id, byDevice: "timeout")`, and publishes `AgentError.permissionTimeout`.
- **Auto-approval rules** are a higher-level service that consumes `permissionRequest` events and synthesizes `respondToPermission` commands; rules are user-editable per project.
- **Headless timeout.** With no client connected, the engine waits `permissionTimeout` (default 5 min) then synthesizes `.deny`.
- **Delivery modes are adapter-owned.** Some agents accept permission answers by pty bytes, some by hook stdout, and Claude can need both. The engine preserves adapter intent and propagates pty write failures for `.writePTY` and `.both`.
- **Stale-edit guard.** `editAndResubmitLast` requires the target bubble UUID to match `lastUserBubbleID`. If it doesn't (because another client already resubmitted), the engine throws `AgentError.staleEditTarget`.

---

## 19. Git diff subsystem

The diff panel is driven by **`AgentEngine`'s FSEvents monitor** plus git porcelain:

```
AgentEngine.start(adapter:workspace:)
  ↓
FSEventsWatcher (workspace, debounced) ──► scheduleDiffRefresh()
  ↓
GitDiffEngine.changedFiles()  (git status --porcelain=v1 -z)
  ↓
ChangedFilesReconciler.reconcile(current:changedFiles, gitPaths:)
  ↓
publish AgentEvent.fileTouched for added paths
  ↓
EngineViewModel → DiffPanelView
```

### Properties

- All git invocations go through `agent_posix_spawn`, **never** through Swift's `Process`. Same fork-safety story as the agent itself.
- FSEvents triggers a coalesced re-scan (`AgentEngine.diffRefreshCoalesce`, 50ms). Debounce avoids storms during big `git checkout` operations.
- `ChangedFilesReconciler` computes added/removed paths so the engine publishes `fileTouched` only for net-new changes.
- If the watcher fails to start, the engine records `SilentDiagnostics` and continues without live diff updates.
- `.gitignore` filtering uses `git check-ignore --stdin`; one round-trip per batch.
- `revert(path:)` runs `git restore -- <path>`; `revertHunk(...)` writes a patch to stdin of `git apply -R --unidiff-zero`.
- The diff engine never reads or modifies files; only `git` does. This keeps the engine's blast radius tiny.

---

## 20. Persistence model

Codemixer persists almost nothing itself. The agent writes JSONL transcripts; the user's `.git` directory carries diff state; the system Keychain carries pairing secrets. The small remainder lives in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/com.codecave.Codemixer/
├── sessions.json        # recent projects (SessionStore)
├── workspaces.json      # Workspace→Projects navigator model
├── prefs.json           # appearance + auto-approval rules (PrefsStore)
└── (Keychain)           # paired-device token hashes, TLS P12 password
~/Library/Caches/Codemixer/uploads/<sessionID>/<uuid>   # attachment staging
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.codecave.Codemixer.daemon.plist  # if LaunchAgent installed
```

### Stores

| Store | File | On decode failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PrefsStore` | `prefs.json` | Use in-memory defaults; record `SilentDiagnostics.prefsQuietReset` |
| `SessionStore` | `sessions.json` | Empty recents list; record `sessionsQuietReset` |
| `WorkspaceProjectsStore` | `workspaces.json` | If `schemaVersion` > supported: keep in-memory defaults + `workspacesSchemaTooNew`; otherwise quiet-reset + `workspacesQuietReset` |
| `PairedDeviceStore` | Keychain | Quiet-reset paired devices + `pairedDevicesQuietReset` |

There is **no** `PrefsMigrator` or forward migration pipeline. Unreadable or unsupported files reset to defaults **silently** — no toast, no blocking dialog. Recovery actions are journaled in `SilentDiagnostics` (see below).

`AppearancePrefs` uses tolerant `decodeIfPresent` for individual keys so adding a field does not invalidate the whole file. Only `workspaces.json` carries an explicit `schemaVersion` integer today.

### `SessionStore`

Recent projects list (most-recent-first, bounded). Persists at `AppSupportPaths.sessionsURL`.

### `PrefsStore`

Persists `AppearancePrefs` and auto-approval rules. Appearance includes theme (`system` / light / dark — no separate "Midnight" theme), density, sidebar visibility, and the opt-in `showSilentRecoveryLog` flag.

### `WorkspaceProjectsStore`

The agent-agnostic model behind the GUI session navigator. A *workspace* is the loaded folder (one window); each workspace owns an ordered list of `ProjectRef`s (path, display name, required `ProjectType`). The workspace root is seeded as the default project; further projects are created as subfolders or added from anywhere on disk.

Project type is dual-persisted: app-support `workspaces.json` *and* `<project>/.codemixer/project.json` (`ProjectPaths` / `ProjectLocalState`). Each workspace also writes its project catalog to `<workspace>/.codemixer/workspace.json` (`WorkspaceLocalState`). That same file optionally caches **Claude Code** model pickers under `adapterModelCaches` (keyed by `AgentID.rawValue`) so print-mode discovery stays rare — see [Model catalogs](#model-catalogs). Other adapters keep models in memory only. `workspaces.json` schema v3 tracks `activeWorkspacePath` so launch restores the last open workspace unless the user chose **Close Workspace**.

```swift
public actor WorkspaceProjectsStore {
    public func projects(for:rootProjectType:) async -> [ProjectRef]          // seeds root
    public func resolveProjectType(for:) async -> ProjectType?      // local file, then index
    public func activeWorkspaceURL() -> URL?                           // launch restore
    public func markActiveWorkspace(_:) async throws
    public func clearActiveWorkspace() async throws                    // Close Workspace
    public func createProject(name:projectType:in:) async throws -> ProjectRef
    public func addExistingProject(url:projectType:in:) async throws -> ProjectRef
    public func renameProject(path:to:in:) async throws -> ProjectRef  // label only
    public func removeProject(path:in:) async throws -> RemovedProject? // never the root
    public func restoreProject(_:in:) async throws                     // undo
    public func cachedModels(for:in:) async -> WorkspaceLocalState.CachedAdapterModels?
    public func saveModels(_:for:refreshedAt:in:) async throws         // Claude catalog only
}
```

It contains **no** Claude/terminal specifics — sessions are not modelled here; they flow through `AgentAdapter.listResumableSessions`, so the navigator works for Claude, Codex, and custom ACP (local `ACPSessionIndex`) alike. Adapters without `.resumableSessions` show *New Chat only*. Navigation actions in `EngineViewModel` (`newChat`, `openSession`) route through the wire `AgentCommand`s `.newSession` / `.openProject`, so the GUI, remote clients, and CLI all reach the same behavior. Sidebar visibility is GUI chrome persisted through `AppearancePrefs` (never on the wire, never `UserDefaults`).

`ProjectType` itself never resolves an adapter — that's `ProjectAgentRouter.resolveAdapter(projectType:sessionAgentID:preferredForNewChat:)`, which special-cases `.custom` (routes through `CustomAgentAdapterFactories`) and otherwise looks up `AgentID` and asks `AdapterRegistry`. Pinned single-agent types (`.claudeCode`, `.codex`, `.cursorCLI`) don't hand-maintain a second `AgentID` switch; they resolve through `SupportedBuiltInAgent.shipping` (`Core/AgentCore/Persistence/SupportedBuiltInAgent.swift`), the same catalog that drives the New/Configure Project pickers. Adding a shipping CLI means extending that one catalog, not every switch that used to enumerate agents by hand.

### Atomic writes

Every persisted file uses the temp + `rename(2)` pattern in `SystemFileSystem.writeAtomically`. Power-loss or crash never leaves a half-written file.

### `SilentDiagnostics` — quiet recovery journal

Always-on ring buffer (`StreamBufferDefaults.silentDiagnostics`) of silent recovery records: quiet-resets, Mode B fallback, cert rotation, wire-version reject, permission delivery failures, etc.

- **Logger:** `category: "SilentDiagnostics"` (mirrors every record at `.notice`).
- **Opt-in UI:** Settings → "Show Silent Recovery Log" (`AppearancePrefs.showSilentRecoveryLog`) opens `SilentDiagnosticsView`.
- **HTTP sidecar:** `GET /v1/diagnostics/silent` (`RemoteDefaults.silentDiagnosticsPath`) returns JSON array of records for scripts.

No user-facing toast on quiet-reset — inspect the journal when debugging persistence or daemon fallback.

---

## 21. Remote control architecture

`AgentRemoteControl` (macOS-only target) turns the engine into a network service.

### Topology

```
NWListener (WebSocket, :8421 — see RemoteDefaults.webSocketPort)
   │
   ├── WebSocket upgrade handler  (path: /v1/ws)
   │       │
   │       ▼
   │   ClientConnection (actor, one per client)
   │       │   ◀── inbound JSON frames ──── decode → AgentCommand → engine.send(_:)
   │       │   ──── outbound JSON frames ───▶ MulticastEventBus subscription → AgentEventWire
   │       │
   │       └── pairing handshake (PIN) or bearer-token auth
   │

   │           return {ref: "attachment://<uuid>"}
   │
   ├── GET  /v1/health
   │       returns {version, engineState, clientCount, uptime}
   │
   └── GET  /v1/diagnostics/silent
           returns JSON array of SilentDiagnostics records
```

### Wire frames

```swift
public enum ClientFrame: Codable, Sendable {
    case command(id: UUID, command: AgentCommand)
    case subscribe(lastSeenEventID: UUID?)
    case snapshot(kind: SnapshotKind)
    case ping(id: UUID)
    case pair(pin: String, clientName: String)
    case auth(token: String)
}

public enum ServerFrame: Codable, Sendable {
    case event(id: UUID, event: AgentEventWire)
    case result(for: UUID, ok: Bool, error: WireAgentError?)
    case snapshot(kind: SnapshotKind, payload: Data)
    case pong(for: UUID)
    case paired(token: String)
    case pairFailed(reason: PairFailureReason)
    case versionMismatch(supported: [WireVersion])
    case subscribed(latestEventID: UUID?, outcome: SubscribeReplayOutcome)
}
```

Every frame carries `"v": WireVersion.current` (today `1`). Decoders reject mismatches — there is no dual-speak across versions.

### Pairing

- **First-time pairing**: Mac UI shows a 6-digit PIN plus a QR (`codemixer://pair?host=...&port=...&fingerprint=<sha256>`). Phone scans, sends `{type: "pair", pin: "...", deviceName: "..."}`. Service verifies with constant-time compare, issues a bearer token (32 random bytes, base64), persists `{deviceName, tokenHash, createdAt, lastSeen}` in Keychain.
- **Lockout**: 5 wrong PIN attempts → 60-second timeout, doubled on each subsequent failure (60 → 120 → 240 → …).
- **TLS cert** is self-signed **RSA-2048** (via `openssl`), stored as PKCS#12 in app support and imported through Keychain. Fingerprint pinning on the client.

### Binding rules

- Default bind: loopback (`127.0.0.1`).
- LAN bind only when `Settings → Remote → Allow LAN connections` is on.
- Toggling the LAN switch rebinds the listener within 100ms (`NWListener.cancel` + new listener with new params).

### Bonjour

`_codemixer._tcp.local.` advertised when remote access is on, with `TXTRecord` `{v=1, device=<host>, pairingState=open|paired}`. Start / stop in lockstep with the listener.

### Multicast coherence and parity

The Mac UI in Mode B is *also* a WebSocket client (on loopback). The same wire codec, the same handshake. **`RemoteParityTests`** is the canary for protocol shape: generated `AgentEvent` streams round-trip through `WireCodec`, and every `AgentCommand` case dispatches through the remote server. **`AgentEngineCommandTests`** own exact PTY bytes and write-failure propagation at the engine seam. **`RemoteControlE2ETests`** then prove those failures surface as failed WebSocket command results, including stateful permission and edit-resubmit paths.

---

## 22. Headless daemon (`codemixerd`)

The daemon is a thin `@main` over `AgentEngine + AgentRemoteControl + ClaudeCode`.

### Properties

- **No SwiftUI.** `codemixerd` does not link `AgentUI`.
- **Idle exit.** With 0 connected clients and `engine.currentState` is `.stopped` or `.stopping` for `DaemonDefaults.idleExitAfterChecks` consecutive checks (`DaemonDefaults.idleCheckInterval` apart — 10 minutes total), the daemon `_exit(0)`s. LaunchAgent's `KeepAlive = {SuccessfulExit: false}` won't restart it. Next GUI launch spawns it again via `launchctl bootstrap`.
- **Crash recovery.** `KeepAlive = {SuccessfulExit: false}` *does* restart on unexpected exits.
- **No GUI bleed.** The daemon never opens windows, never makes alerts, never calls `NSAlert`/`UNNotificationCenter` (notifications are the client's concern).

### Install / uninstall

- **Install**: `Settings → Remote → Enable on login` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.codecave.Codemixer.daemon.plist` and `launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID <plist>`. The GUI now connects via loopback.
- **Uninstall**: toggle off → `launchctl bootout gui/$UID/com.codecave.Codemixer.daemon` → remove the plist. GUI falls back to in-process Mode A.

### Loopback bridging (Mode B probe)

When the LaunchAgent is installed or `CODEMIXER_UI_BACKEND=daemon` is set, `Bootstrap` probes the daemon via `RemoteEngineClient.connect()`. On success the GUI is a loopback WebSocket client (same wire as any remote peer). On failure it records `SilentDiagnostics.modeBFallback` and starts an in-process `AgentEngine` instead — no error toast.

`Bootstrap.startAppEventBridge` subscribes to the bus and wires `bell` / hook status phrases → `UserNotificationBridge`, and TTS requests. Agent auth and missing-binary failures surface as `startupError` / diagnostics (`authenticationRequired`, `binaryNotFound`) — there is no in-app agent login or install sheet.

---

## 23. Security model

A native Mac app that spawns child processes, opens TTYs, watches arbitrary files, and exposes a network service requires care.

### App-level

- **App Sandbox disabled.** We spawn `claude` from arbitrary paths, attach to arbitrary working directories, run git on them. The sandbox cannot accommodate this.
- **Hardened Runtime enabled.** No `com.apple.security.cs.*` exemptions are needed because we do not load third-party dylibs.
- **TCC purpose strings**: `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`, `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` (only if we ever script Finder; not in v1), `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` (when LAN bind is on).
- **Notarization** at release time via `xcrun notarytool`.

### Process spawning

- `posix_spawn` only — never `Process`, never `fork() + exec()` from Swift.
- `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID | POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT` — child can't inherit our open file descriptors.
- `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` at startup so PTY closes don't kill us.

### Remote-control auth

- **PIN**: 6 random decimal digits from `SecRandomCopyBytes`. 90-second expiry. Constant-time compare via `CryptoKit.SymmetricKey.timingSafeCompare`.
- **Lockout**: 5 attempts → exponential backoff.
- **Bearer tokens**: 32 random bytes, base64-encoded, stored as SHA-256 hash in Keychain (we compare the hash, never the token). Per-device, revocable.
- **TLS certificate**: self-signed RSA-2048 via `CertificateManager`, fingerprint shown in the pairing QR for client-side pinning. TLS is controlled by `RemoteControlServer.Configuration.useTLS`: the GUI embedded server defaults to TLS on; `codemixerd` defaults to plain WebSocket on loopback for local development.
- **Port ownership**: `RemoteDefaults.webSocketPort` (8421) and `RemoteDefaults.sidecarPort` (8422) are the single source of truth — do not hardcode ports elsewhere.

### Logging

- `os.Logger` everywhere; prompt text and file paths are tagged `.private`, PIDs and durations are `.public`, errors are `.public` with the actionable line only. Console.app shows public fields; full payloads require a sysdiagnose.

### What we never do

- Store user prompts on disk outside the JSONL transcripts the agent itself writes.
- Send any telemetry of any kind.
- Embed an analytics SDK.
- Use third-party crash reporters.

---

## 24. Error model

Every layer defines a typed `Error` enum carrying rich context. Examples:

```swift
public enum PTYError: Error, Sendable {
    case openpty(errno: Int32)
    case nonBlocking(errno: Int32, fd: Int32)
    case spawn(errno: Int32, executable: URL)
    case write(errno: Int32, bytes: Int)
    case alreadyClosed
}

public enum AgentError: Error, Codable, Sendable {

    case lockedOut(retryAfter: Duration)
    case versionMismatch(server: Int, client: Int)
    case malformedFrame(detail: String)
    case sizeLimitExceeded(limit: Int)
}
```

### Rules

- **Errors are typed at the throwing site.** Closed error sets use plain `throws` with a dedicated `Error` enum — the codebase does not use Swift typed throws (`throws(SomeError)`) today.
- **Errors that cross the wire are `Codable`.** Remote clients see the same case the engine raised, complete with associated values.
- **`localizedDescription`** is implemented per case with actionable phrasing — *"binary not found at /usr/local/bin/claude — install with `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`"* — not opaque enum names.
- **No `fatalError` outside of `Logger.fatal` shims**, which assert in debug and `os_log_fault` in release.

## 25. Performance model

The engine is not bandwidth-bound; user perception is. Latency budgets:

| From → To | Budget | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User keystroke → composer character | < 16 ms | `@MainActor` direct binding |
| Send button → first PTY byte | < 30 ms | One `await pty.write` |
| First PTY byte → first transcript event | 100 – 1000 ms | Agent-bound; out of our control |
| Adapter event → bus publish | < 1 ms | Pure async stream |
| Bus publish → Mac UI render | < 16 ms | One hop through `EngineViewModel` |
| Bus publish → remote client byte on wire | < 5 ms | One WSS frame |
| PTY byte → diff panel refresh | ≤ 50 ms | FSEvents debounce |
| `cancelCurrentTurn` → child SIGTERM observed | < 100 ms | Direct `killpg` |
| Daemon idle → `_exit(0)` | 10 min | Idle timer |

### Throughput

- PTY read is `DispatchIO`-backed; tested to 4 MiB/s without backpressure.
- Bus fan-out is N-subscriber tested at 1000 events/sec × 50 subscribers without drops.
- Transcript tail is one `read(2)` per FSEvents tick; constant per-event cost.

### Memory caps

- Bus ring buffer: 500 events × ~2KB each ≈ 1 MB.
- Per-client outbound queue: 1024 events × ~2KB ≈ 2 MB / client. With 50 clients that's 100 MB; we cap simultaneous clients at 16 in v1.
- Transcript tail buffer: 64 KB rolling window.
- Snapshot ring inside `TerminalEngine`: 5 snapshots × 120×40 cells ≈ 240 KB.

### Reduce-Motion / low-power

When the system reports Reduce Motion or low-power mode, ShimmerDots become static, `noEventGap` emission slows from 500ms to 1s, and bus fan-out batches per 100ms window.

### Patterns

- **Swift Testing** throughout (`@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`). No XCTest.
- **Golden fixtures** for the TUI parser, hook decoder, transcript decoder, and `WireCodec`. Diffs are reviewed at PR time; regenerating a golden requires explicit approval.
- **Property tests** for `WireCodec` round-trips, state-machine fold associativity, and bus replay determinism.
- **Deterministic time** via `FakeClock`; avoid wall-clock sleeps except for
  short async-stream drain points and real-PTY integration coverage.
- **Scripted transport seam tests** in `AgentEngineCommandTests` inject `AgentTransport`
  doubles to cover exact bytes and failure propagation for every transport-writing
  command: `.sendPrompt`, `.cancelCurrentTurn`, typed slash commands,
  `.editAndResubmitLast`, and every `respondToPermission` delivery mode.
- **Remote transport failure E2E tests** in `Remote/AgentRemoteControlTests/RemoteControlE2ETests` use the same seam
  behind an in-memory WebSocket server to prove command failures become failed
  wire results and `.sendPrompt` preserves event-before-error ordering.
- **Real-PTY integration** uses `/bin/echo` or similar in `PTYHostTests`; there is no separate Linux CI matrix (package is macOS-only).

## 27. Tooling and enforcement

Architecture survives review through **local scripts** and the pre-merge checklist in `docs/style/code-style.md` §26. There is no checked-in GitHub Actions workflow today (`.github/` may be absent).

| Tool | What it enforces |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/pre-commit.swift` | **Narrow gate:** `swift build`, `swift test --no-parallel`, SwiftFormat lint, SwiftLint. Install via `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. |
| `scripts/check-no-swiftui-imports.swift` | SwiftUI imports only in allowed UI targets. |
| `scripts/check-direct-framework-calls.swift` | Wrapped Apple APIs only through `External/` seams. |
| `scripts/check-a11y.swift` | Icon-only controls have accessibility metadata. |
| `scripts/regen-coverage-manifest.swift --check` | Public API surface matches `CoverageManifest.swift`. |
| `scripts/check-package-layout.swift` | Test suite layout matches `Package.swift`. |
| `scripts/check-test-runtime.swift` | Per-suite runtime budgets (pipe `swift test` output). |
| Pre-merge review checklist | Human gate in `code-style.md` §26 and `docs/reference/templates/pr.template.md`. |

**Full merge gate** (run manually before opening a PR):

```bash
swift build && swift test --no-parallel
scripts/check-package-layout.swift
scripts/check-no-swiftui-imports.swift
scripts/check-direct-framework-calls.swift
scripts/check-a11y.swift
scripts/regen-coverage-manifest.swift --check
swift test --no-parallel 2>&1 | scripts/check-test-runtime.swift
```

## 28. End-to-end data flows

Three canonical walkthroughs. Reading them in order is the fastest way to internalize the architecture.

### 28.1 Sending a prompt

```
1. User types "fix the test failure" in ComposerView, hits Cmd-Return.
2. `PromptComposerView` / `EngineViewModel` constructs:
     AgentCommand.sendPrompt(text: "fix the test failure", attachments: [])
3. View model calls: await engine.send(.sendPrompt(...))
   (where `engine` is either an in-process AgentEngine actor OR a
    loopback EngineRemoteProxy that wraps a WSS connection — either way,
    the same AgentEngineCommandPort.)
4. AgentEngine actor receives the command:
     - lastUserBubbleID = seams.random.uuid()
     - bytes = adapter.encodeUserPrompt("fix the test failure")  // for Claude: text + "\r"
     - await bus.publish(.userTurn(id: ..., text: ...))
     - currentTurnID = lastUserBubbleID
     - heartbeat.startTurn(...)
     - await pty.write(bytes)
5. PTYHost writes bytes to the master FD.
6. The kernel delivers them to Claude's slave PTY; Ink TUI displays them.
7. Claude begins processing, emits "user_prompt_submit" hook to our UDS.
8. ClaudeAdapter decodes the hook envelope, ignores it (already published).
9. Claude streams the assistant's thinking, then chat blocks, into its
   transcript JSONL. ClaudeTranscriptTailer reads new lines.
10. Tailer emits AgentEvent.thinkingChunk(...) per delta.
11. AgentEngine.ingest forwards each event to bus.publish.
12. Each subscriber (Mac UI EngineViewModel + 0..N remote clients) gets
    the AsyncStream tick and renders.
13. Final chat block: tailer emits assistantText(isFinal: true).
14. heartbeat.endTurn() → activityStateChanged(.idle).
```

### 28.2 A tool call with permission

```
1. Claude wants to run `git push`. It emits a "pre_tool_use" hook.
2. HookServer receives the envelope; ClaudeAdapter decodes:
     - toolName = "Bash", input = "git push"
     - PermissionPrompt(id: UUID, tool: "Bash", input: ..., risk: .write)
3. Adapter emits AgentEvent.permissionRequest(prompt).
4. Engine ingests; pendingPermissions[id] = prompt; bus.publish.
5. Mac UI's ConversationViewModel inserts an inline PermissionCard.
6. iPhone Codemixer Remote (if connected) gets the same event via WSS,
   renders the same card.
7. User taps "Approve" on the phone. Phone sends:
     ServerFrame? No — ClientFrame.command(.respondToPermission(id, .allow))
8. RemoteControlServer decodes, calls engine.send(.respondToPermission(...)).
9. AgentEngine:
     - prompt = pendingPermissions.removeValue(forKey: id)
     - delivery = adapter.encodePermissionResponse(.allow, for: prompt)
     - switch delivery:
         .writePTY(d) → pty.write(d)                 (TUI prompts accept "y\n")
         .respondToHookProcess(json) → hookServer.respond(id, json)
         .both(p, h) → pty.write(p), then hookServer.respond(id, h)
10. If the pty write fails, the same error propagates through `engine.send`;
    remote clients receive a failed command result. If delivery succeeds,
    Claude proceeds with the tool; toolStart/toolProgress/toolEnd flow as usual.
11. A second client responding after the prompt was removed is a no-op; timeout
    auto-denial publishes `permissionAlreadyResolved(id, byDevice: "timeout")`
    so stale cards can collapse.
```

### 28.3 Mid-session file revert from the diff panel

```
1. User clicks "Revert" on a hunk in DiffPanelView.
2. DiffPanelViewModel: engine.send(.revertHunk(url, hunkID: ...))
3. AgentEngine recognises this as out-of-band: routes to GitDiffEngine.
4. GitDiffEngine.revert(hunk:):
     - locate hunk in the cached unified diff
     - construct a unified-diff patch with leading "-/+" inverted
     - agent_posix_spawn `git apply -R --unidiff-zero` with patch on stdin
5. FSEventsWatcher fires on the workspace path (debounced 50ms).
6. GitDiffEngine re-runs status/diff, publishes new ChangedFile list.
7. DiffPanelViewModel updates. Mac UI redraws. Phone (subscribed) too.
```

These three flows touch every joint in the system. Reviewers should be able to reproduce them on a whiteboard.

## 29. Failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Detection | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent process crashes mid-turn | `ChildReaper` observes `SIGCHLD`, `waitpid` returns abnormal status | Engine publishes `.stopped(reason: .crashed)` + `.error(.adapter(...))`. UI shows recovery sheet ("Restart session"). One click → fresh engine, `--resume` if adapter supports it. |
| Transport write fails | `AgentTransport.write` throws `AgentTransportError` | The command throws. Remote callers receive a failed command result; GUI callers roll back optimistic state where applicable. `.sendPrompt` has already published `.userTurn` by design. |
| Transcript file missing | Tailer's `open(2)` fails | Adapter emits `error(.adapter("transcript", "missing"))`. UI shows banner ("Live updates unavailable; using TUI fallback only"). |
| Hook UDS socket conflict | `NWListener.start` fails with EADDRINUSE | Engine tries `${TMPDIR}/codemixer-<pid>.sock`; retries up to 3 times with fresh paths. |
| Remote client falls behind | Subscriber queue drops oldest events (`bufferingOldest`) | Client reconnects with `lastSeenEventID`; if checkpoint expired, receives `subscribed(outcome: .checkpointExpired)` and `.engineRestarted`, then requests snapshots. |
| Unreadable prefs/sessions/workspaces | JSON decode throws on load | Quiet-reset to defaults; `SilentDiagnostics` records the failure (no toast). |
| Mode B daemon unreachable | `RemoteEngineClient.connect()` fails | `Bootstrap` falls back to in-process engine; records `SilentDiagnostics.modeBFallback`. |
| Daemon crash | LaunchAgent restarts via `KeepAlive` | GUI's `EngineConnection` reconnects on `/v1/health` becoming 200 again; sends `subscribe(lastSeenEventID:)`; bus replays. |
| TLS cert expired | Client cert validation fails | UI shows "Refresh TLS cert" in Settings → Remote; one click regenerates and re-shares fingerprint. All paired clients must re-pair. |
| Pairing PIN brute-force | 5 failed attempts in 90s window | Exponential lockout starting 60s. Logged with `pin_lockout_started` to Console. |
| FSEvents storm | > 1000 events / sec | Debounce widens from 50ms → 250ms automatically; `GitDiffEngine` runs at most once per debounce window. |
| Network drop on mobile | WSS heartbeat (15s) misses | Server marks subscriber `.stale`, keeps queue alive 60s. Client reconnect within 60s gets replay; later gets `engineRestarted` + full snapshot. |

The general principle: **every user-visible failure produces a typed event or error message.** Silent recoveries (quiet-reset, daemon fallback, cert regen) go to `SilentDiagnostics` and the system log — not toasts.

---

## 30. Versioning and wire-protocol evolution

The wire protocol is the most rigid part of the system because clients we don't control will speak it.

### Version field

Every frame carries `"v": WireVersion.current` (today `1`), declared in `Core/AgentProtocol/WireVersion.swift`. Decoders read `v` first; mismatches produce `ServerFrame.versionMismatch(supported:)` and a `SilentDiagnostics.wireVersionRejected` record. **There is no dual-speak** — servers and clients must agree on the version.

### Compatibility policy

- **Additive change** (new optional field on an existing case): usually no version bump; ship coordinated adapter + codec updates.
- **Breaking change** (renamed tag, removed field, stricter decoding): bump `WireVersion.current`; old clients are rejected cleanly.
- **No `unknown` wire catch-alls.** Wire enums decode exhaustively; new cases require a version bump and coordinated release.

### Persistence evolution

Only `workspaces.json` uses an explicit `schemaVersion`. Other stores tolerate new keys via `decodeIfPresent` or quiet-reset on total decode failure (see §20). There are no forward migrators.

---

## 31. Extension recipes

The architecture is designed for additions. Five common cases:

### 31.1 Adding a new agent adapter

1. Scaffold `src/AgenticCLIs/<AgentName>/` with `Adapter/`, `Common/`, optional `digital-twin/`, and contract `README.md` — see [`src/AgenticCLIs/README.md`](../src/AgenticCLIs/README.md).
2. Add an SPM library target + product under that path; top-level type conforming to `AgentAdapter`.
3. Declare `transportDescriptor` and capabilities, e.g. `.stdioJSONRPC` plus `[.permissionPrompts]`.
4. Implement `sessionBootstrapBytes(context:)`, `encodeCommand(_:)`, and `makeEventStream(inputs:)` — parse bytes from `inputs.outputBytes`, emit `AgentEvent`s.
5. Register at startup: `await AdapterRegistry.shared.register(CursorAdapter())` in `CodemixerApp` / `CodemixerDaemon` only.
6. Add agent-specific tests in `tests/AgenticCLIs/<AgentName>/<Agent>AdapterTests/` (optional `<Agent>TwinTests/`) — see [`tests/AgenticCLIs/README.md`](../tests/AgenticCLIs/README.md).

No edits to `AgentCore`, `AgentUI`, `AgentProtocol`, or `AgentRemoteControl`. If the new agent needs a new capability flag, that's a one-line addition to `AgentCapabilities` and a corresponding wiring branch in `AgentEngine.start`.

### 31.2 Adding a new tool renderer

1. Add a case to `ToolRenderHint` if the existing ones don't fit.
2. Extend `ToolCallCardView` with the new rendering branch.
3. Keep renderer-specific state private to that view.
4. Update relevant adapters' `toolRenderHint(toolName:, input:)` to return the new case.
5. Add `RemoteParityTests` coverage if the new hint round-trips over the wire.

### 31.3 Adding a new `AgentCommand`

1. Add a case to `AgentCommand` in `AgentProtocol`.
2. Add handling in `AgentEngine.send(_:)`.
3. If it writes to the pty, add exact-byte and write-failure coverage in
   `AgentEngineCommandTests`; multi-step commands cover each write point.
4. Update `RemoteParityTests` to cover the new case.
5. Add `RemoteControlE2ETests` coverage when remote clients need a specific
   command-result or event-ordering guarantee.
6. Add a Mac UI surface (button, menu item, voice phrase).
7. Update remote-control docs.

### 31.4 Adding a new `AgentEvent`

1. Add a case to `AgentEvent` in `AgentCore`.
2. Add the parallel case to `AgentEventWire` in `AgentProtocol`.
3. Extend `WireCodec` to convert both directions.
4. Update `RemoteParityTests` with a round-trip case.
5. Add at least one consumer in the Mac UI (or document why none is wanted).
6. Update the conversation reducer if the event affects state.

### 31.5 Adding a new wire frame

Rare. Bumps the wire version unless purely additive. Requires a checklist sign-off: protocol owner, security reviewer, mobile-client (when it ships) compatibility lead.

---

## 32. Trade-offs and rejected alternatives

| Considered | Why rejected |
| --- | --- |
| **`Process` (`NSTask`) instead of `posix_spawn`** | `Process` doesn't expose PTY allocation; we'd need to subclass / FFI anyway. Doing `posix_spawn` directly is cleaner and avoids Swift runtime fork-safety issues. |
| **Anthropic SDK / `--print` / stream-json** | Routes to the API billing pool, violating the interactive-subscription constraint after June 15, 2026. |
| **Embed `claude` as a sub-binary in our bundle** | Licensing + update cadence mismatch. We always run the user's installed `claude`. |
| **Mirror transcripts into SQLite for fast search** | Duplicate state, eventually-divergent. Claude's JSONL is the canonical source; we tail it. Full-text search is a roadmap item using ripgrep over the JSONL files, not a parallel DB. |
| **Express/Node UI shared with web** | Inconsistent with native macOS feel and the no-terminal constraint. We do ship a WSS server, but the primary GUI is native SwiftUI. |
| **`@MainActor`-isolated `AgentEngine`** | Breaks Mode B (daemon has no main thread in the SwiftUI sense). Engine must be a plain `actor`. |
| **Bus = `Combine` `PassthroughSubject`** | Combine's back-pressure model is poor for N-subscriber fan-out and replay; an actor-based bus is more straightforward and Sendable-correct. |
| **WebSocket over plain HTTP** | LAN exposure with no encryption is unacceptable. TLS only. |
| **Tor / mesh fallback for remote control** | Out of scope. The intended use is one phone on the same Wi-Fi as the Mac. |
| **OAuth / external IdP for pairing** | Overkill for a local-network app. PIN + bearer token + Keychain is enough and keeps Codemixer offline-first. |
| **Persistent per-event id schema** | Engine-issued UUIDs at publish time are enough; persisting them in the bus ring is sufficient for reconnect-with-replay. |
| **In-place transcript rewrite for edits** | Claude appends to JSONL; rewriting is corrupting. Edits work by sending a new `userTurn` and letting Claude reprocess. |
| **`OperationQueue` for child waitpid** | Signal handling on `OperationQueue` is fragile; `DispatchSource.signal` is the system-blessed path. |
| **Two separate Xcode projects for GUI and daemon** | Sharing source via SPM in one xcodeproj is simpler. The two targets share everything except the executable entry. |
| **Use `URLSession` WebSocket task** | Server-side is `NWListener` for control over the TLS identity and binding interface; client-side is the same so behaviour is symmetric and testable. |

---

## 33. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Adapter** | A module conforming to `AgentAdapter` that knows one specific CLI agent. `ClaudeCode` in v1 (ships `ClaudeAdapter`). |
| **AgentCommand** | The typed input alphabet sent into the engine. |
| **AgentEvent** | The typed output alphabet emitted by the engine. |
| **AgentEventWire** | Codable mirror of `AgentEvent` in `AgentProtocol`. |
| **AgentEngineCommandPort** | The single inbound protocol the engine implements: `send(_ command: AgentCommand)`. |
| **Bus** | `MulticastEventBus` — the fan-out actor. |
| **Capability** | A bit in `AgentCapabilities` indicating which signal sources an adapter wants. |
| **Daemon** | The `codemixerd` binary running headless in the background. |
| **Engine** | `AgentEngine` — the orchestrator actor. |
| **Headless** | Running without a UI process. The engine + remote-control server, no SwiftUI. |
| **Hook** | A small JSON payload Claude sends to a sidecar process at lifecycle points. We receive them via our UDS hook server. |
| **JSONL transcript** | Newline-delimited JSON file Claude writes during a session, at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`. |
| **Loopback bridging** | The Mac GUI talks to the daemon via `127.0.0.1` WSS, same wire as remote clients. |
| **Mode A / Mode B** | In-process / daemon-backed deployment shapes. |
| **MockAdapter** | Test-only adapter that replays scripted `AgentEvent` sequences. |
| **PIN** | Six-digit pairing code for first-time device association. |
| **Port** | An inbound or outbound boundary protocol. `AgentEngineCommandPort` is one. |
| **PTY** | Pseudo-terminal — a kernel-level "fake terminal" used to keep `claude` in interactive mode while hiding it from the user. |
| **PTYHost** | Actor owning the master FD. |
| **Reaper** | `ChildReaper` — the SIGCHLD handler. |
| **Remote client** | A WSS-connected consumer of the engine — Mac GUI in Mode B, iOS app, scripts. See §4.1 for the client-role vs connected-peer-count distinction. |
| **Ring buffer** | Bounded queue of last-N events for replay on reconnect. 500 events in v1. |
| **Seam** | A protocol-typed dependency injection point. `Clock`, `RandomSource`, `Environment`, `FileSystem`. |
| **TerminalEngine** | Actor wrapping `SwiftTerm.Terminal` headless. |
| **TUI fallback** | Last-resort signal source — scraping the SwiftTerm headless snapshot when nothing else has the information. |
| **WireCodec** | The single converter between `AgentEvent` and `AgentEventWire`. |

## 34. When in doubt

- **When in doubt about where a piece of code goes**, ask the dependency arrow (§6). Code lands in the lowest layer that can express it.
- **When in doubt about whether something is event or state**, prefer event. State is a fold; events are the truth.
- **When in doubt about whether to add a command or a service**, ask "would a mobile-only user need this?" If yes, it's a command.
- **When in doubt about a new event case**, ask "would two different clients need to agree on this exact moment?" If yes, it's an event.
- **When in doubt about a `@MainActor` annotation**, you almost certainly don't want one. The seam lives in `AgentUI`.
- **When in doubt about test determinism**, route through a seam.
- **When in doubt about a wire change**, write the `RemoteParityTests` case first.
- **When in doubt about security**, default closed: loopback bind, lockout on retries, hash-not-plaintext in Keychain, `.private` log fields.
- **When in doubt about novelty**, prefer the boring shape. Codemixer's complexity is in its constraints, not its cleverness.

If after all this you still cannot decide, propose the decision in the PR description with the trade-offs made explicit; the reviewer's job is to lock the direction for future readers.
